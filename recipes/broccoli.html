    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>  
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
